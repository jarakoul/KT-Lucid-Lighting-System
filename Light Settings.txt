# =KT= Lucid Lighting System
# Light settings configuration for an individual light - How the light looks

# These are the settings for when the light first turns/toggles on
# Commands from switches can change intensity and color

# conserving sim resources and getting finer control over lighting

# Face(s) to affect when turning on the light
# If one face, put the face number (Face=2)
# If all faces, put AllFaces (Face=AllFaces)
# If a list of several faces, use list format (Face=[2,3])
# If NO faces, put FALSE or an empty list (Face=[])
Face = 0

# always match the lighting Color (from below or from the switch)

# Whether or not to set full bright on the specified faces, TRUE or FALSE
